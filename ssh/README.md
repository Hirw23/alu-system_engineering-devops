SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote systems over a network. It encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring secure communication. Here's an overview of how SSH works and some common commands and configurations:

How SSH Works
Client-Server Model: SSH uses a client-server model. The client initiates the connection, and the server responds to it.
Encryption: SSH encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
Authentication: SSH supports various authentication methods, including password-based authentication and key-based authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and ED25519 keys).
